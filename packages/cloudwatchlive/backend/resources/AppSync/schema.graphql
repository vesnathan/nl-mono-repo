# Ensure that Query, Mutation, CWLUser, ClientType, and CreateCWLUserInput are primarily defined in users.graphql

# Import all necessary types and operations from users.graphql
# The GraphQL spec typically handles imports by making all definitions from the imported file available.
# Specific tooling might have different ways of handling or requiring these import statements.
# For AWS AppSync, often you combine schemas before deployment or reference them in a way the service understands.

# If your tooling merges .graphql files, these imports might be directives for that tooling.
# If AppSync is directly consuming multiple .graphql files (e.g. via CloudFormation pointing to a directory or multiple files),
# then these explicit import lines might not be standard GraphQL but a specific directive for that setup.

# Assuming standard GraphQL or a tool that understands these comments for merging:
# The types Query, Mutation, CWLUser, ClientType, CreateCWLUserInput will be pulled from users.graphql

# import Mutation.* from "./users.graphql" # This imports all Mutations
# import Query.* from "./users.graphql"   # This imports all Queries
# import CWLUser.* from "./users.graphql" # This imports the CWLUser type
# import ClientType.* from "./users.graphql" # This imports the ClientType enum
# import CreateCWLUserInput.* from "./users.graphql" # This imports the CreateCWLUserInput input type

# It's generally better to have a single point of definition.
# The schema block above defines that a Query and Mutation type exist.
# The actual fields for Query and Mutation should come from users.graphql if that's where they are defined.

# If your build process concatenates all .graphql files in the schema/ directory, 
# then you don't need these import lines, and you must ensure no duplicate definitions across files.
# Let's assume users.graphql contains the full definitions for Query, Mutation, and related user types.
# And this schema.graphql is the entry point that might reference them or be combined.

# For clarity and to avoid re-definitions if files are simply concatenated:
# Remove explicit Query definition if it's fully in users.graphql
# type Query {
# getCWLUser(userId: String!): CWLUser
# @aws_cognito_user_pools
# }

# The @aws_cognito_user_pools directive would be on the getCWLUser field within users.graphql if that's its definition source.
