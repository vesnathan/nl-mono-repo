# This file should only extend Query and Mutation types or define types specific to this AppSync API's user handling
# if they are NOT already defined in shared/types.

# Assuming CWLUser, ClientType, and CreateCWLUserInput are defined in shared/types
# and will be merged by the buildGql.ts script.

type Mutation {
  # Creates a new CWL User
  createCWLUser(input: CWLUserInput!): CWLUser # Changed CreateCWLUserInput to CWLUserInput
}

type Query {
  # Retrieves a CWLUser by their ID (Cognito Sub)
  getCWLUser(userId: String!): CWLUser
    @aws_cognito_user_pools # Directive for AppSync authorization
}

# The actual definitions for CWLUser, CreateCWLUserInput, and ClientType
# should come from the .graphql files in packages/shared/types/
# and be merged by your build scripts.
# Example (these would be in a file like packages/shared/types/userTypes.graphql):
#
# input CreateCWLUserInput {
#   organizationId: String!
#   userEmail: String!
#   userTitle: String
#   userFirstName: String!
#   userLastName: String!
#   userPhone: String!
#   userRole: String!
# }
#
# type CWLUser {
#   userId: String!
#   organizationId: String!
#   userEmail: String!
#   userTitle: String
#   userFirstName: String!
#   userLastName: String!
#   userPhone: String!
#   userRole: String!
#   privacyPolicy: Boolean
#   termsAndConditions: Boolean
#   userAddedById: String
#   userCreated: String!
#   clientType: [ClientType!]!
# }
#
# enum ClientType {
#   SuperAdmin
#   EventCompanyAdmin
#   # ... other roles
# }
