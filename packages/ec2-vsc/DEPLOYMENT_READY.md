# 🎉 EC2 VSCode Server - Deployment Ready!

## ✅ Package Complete

The **EC2 VSCode Server** package has been successfully created and is ready for deployment! All tests have passed:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build system working
- ✅ CloudFormation template validated
- ✅ CLI interface functional
- ✅ All dependencies installed

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Navigate to the Package
```bash
cd packages/ec2-vsc
```

### 2. Deploy Your VSCode Server
```bash
# Basic deployment (recommended for first time)
yarn deploy

# Custom deployment with options
yarn deploy -t t3.large -k my-aws-key -s 50 -n my-vscode-server
```

### 3. Follow Interactive Prompts
During deployment, you'll be asked for:
- **VSCode password** (minimum 8 characters) - This is what you'll use to login
- **AWS credentials** (if not already configured in the deploy package)

**Credential Sharing**: This package automatically uses AWS credentials from the deploy package if they exist and are valid. You only need to enter credentials once for the entire monorepo!

### 4. Access Your Server
After deployment (takes ~10-15 minutes), you'll see:
